# listBuilder
A simple program that takes an input file, singles out the words, outputs a list that could be easily plugged back into Python as a variable.

In its current form, it's fairly simple.

It reads a local input.txt file as a string, makes it all lowercase, regex for anything over one letter long, produces a final list ignoring duplicates, alphabetizes it, then compiles it into a string again with quotes and brackets so that the results are essentially a python list, and puts them into output.txt.

I wouldn't have bothered uploading, but I wanted to add simple GUI and let you select an input file. So it's here until I bother to do that.
